###about memcpyt
- I learned about the pointers, to cast, the use of void type in those kind of situations, angele helped me to 
  find where was my mistakes. (I did use too much * when I just created the pointers, check ft_memcpy.c for more
  info) I also find out a way to make a better while function : while (n--) dest_char++ =src_char++;

###about memmove
- variable that is unused and useless have to correct it at some point

###about strlcpy
- have to verify a bit more if everything is in order. it seems to be the case but I wanna be sure before getting an evaluation and maybe make my code more compact :>

###about strlcat
- was complicated, I may have failed ####strlcpy, have to check at some point, do not hesitate to get back to the function to make sure I understand everything about it.

###about ft_strchr.c
- Struggled with the cast, would be a good idea to check that once again!

###about ft_strrchr.c
- Learn about pointers and arrays (like you can navigate trough array with string++ for exemple)

###about ft_strncmp.c 
- learned how to make my synthax super compact!!!

###about ft_memchr.c 
- dear princess celestia, today I learned that casting is not always the solution, but also pointers can be your true and most loyal friends during harsh time, and that friendship is cool  and magic and stuff blabla  and it does help a lot during my journey to become a better dev, also it is kinda late, good night.
