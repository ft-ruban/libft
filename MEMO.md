###about memcpyt
- I learned about the pointers, to cast, the use of void type in those kind of situations, angele helped me to 
  find where was my mistakes. (I did use too much * when I just created the pointers, check ft_memcpy.c for more
  info) I also find out a way to make a better while function : while (n--) dest_char++ =src_char++;
