###about memcpyt
- I learned about the pointers, to cast, the use of void type in those kind of situations, angele helped me to 
  find where was my mistakes. (I did use too much * when I just created the pointers, check ft_memcpy.c for more
  info) I also find out a way to make a better while function : while (n--) dest_char++ =src_char++;

###about memmove
- variable that is unused and useless have to correct it at some point

###about strlcpy
- have to verify a bit more if everything is in order. it seems to be the case but I wanna be sure before getting an evaluation and maybe make my code more compact :>

###about strlcat
- was complicated, I may have failed ####strlcpy, have to check at some point, do not hesitate to get back to the function to make sure I understand everything about it.
